# QcaBluetooth

Qualcomm WCN7850 Bluetooth driver for XNU. It runs the Linux `btqca.c` startup
sequence over a GENI UART and connects the controller to Apple's `bluetoothd`.

## Status

Device: Xiaomi Pad 6S Pro (sheng), iPadOS 27.0.1 (24A446).

The table below is the upstream author's sheng record. The consuming nezha
Bluetooth27 adaptation has separately reached a real UART controller-version
reply on 2026-11-09, followed by a baud-change timeout in002 and003. Nezha pairing and audio
are still unverified; see the device's Bluetooth27 handoff. Its board selects
the actual SM8850 DFS clock bank when enabled and uses a bounded Ganges reply
observation. The003 hardware had DFS disabled. The next source aligns Ganges
RTS-only flow and write/20ms/drain ordering with the actual Android HAL, and
aligns the ordinary RCG control bits with Linux; target validation is pending.

| State | Features |
| --- | --- |
| Working | Pairing, reconnection after reboot, power toggle, A2DP playback, AirPods noise control and battery, use alongside Wi-Fi |
| Not tested | Calls and microphone (HFP/SCO), sleep and wake |
| Unavailable | Features that need Apple vendor commands |

## Layout

| Path | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `include/qbt.h`, `src/qbt_core.c` | Linux initialization, H4 framing and IBS on one executor |
| `include/qbt_geni.h`, `src/qbt_geni.c` | GENI SE DMA: four 2048-byte RX buffers, one 4096-byte TX buffer |
| `include/qbt_transport.h`, `src/qbt_transport.c` | UART.SK kernel pipe, backpressure, channel lifetime and worker power requests |
| `src/qbt_linux.c`, `shim/` | Boundary to the locked Linux sources |
| `userland/BlueTool.c` | `com.apple.BlueTool` XPC bootstrap service |
| `userland/Type0.c` | Capabilities from HCI reports for the native stack |
| `tools/` | Native daemon patch, signing, source lock and checks |

The board supplies WCN power, clocks, pins, IRQs, mapped DMA addresses and
firmware. Pairing, key storage, BLE and audio profiles run in `bluetoothd`.
[Native routing](native-ios27.md) describes the iPadOS 27 adapter.

## Kernel interface

| Sysctl | Access | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `kern.qbt_boot` | Read | Controller state |
| `kern.qbt_power_on` | Read | Reading starts the controller and returns the result |
| `kern.qbt_firmware` | Read | Loaded firmware name |

`kern.qbt_power_on` is a read because BlueTool's sandbox denies sysctl writes.

## Checks

```sh
python3 tools/test-runtime.py
python3 tools/test-geni.py
python3 tools/build-bluetool.py
python3 tools/build-type0.py
python3 tools/check-kernel.py /path/to/tree --record <kernel source compile record> \
    --extra-source <board source> --board-export <symbol>
```

`tools/prepare-linux.py` verifies the source hash and stages byte-identical Linux
code in `out/linux`. `QBT_LINUX_TREE` selects an existing Linux checkout.

## Sources and licenses

Linux initialization and GENI/H4/IBS code use GPL-2.0-only. `src/qbt_transport.c`
uses APSL-2.0, and `userland/Type0.c` uses BSD-3-Clause. Public interfaces and
BlueTool use BSD-2-Clause-Patent. Each file identifies its license;
[NOTICE](NOTICE.md) and `tools/source-lock.json` record attribution.

Vendor firmware and Apple binaries are external inputs and stay out of this
